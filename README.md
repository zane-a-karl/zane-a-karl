### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**zane-a-karl/zane-a-karl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects in C, Rust, and JS
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Networking and Crypto
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything!
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with math because I will be trying to tackle some textbooks in subjects I find difficult.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything and I will find an answer if I don't already have one.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was an extra in the movie "The Way Back"!
